"""
    eachobsparallel(data; buffer, executor, channelsize)

Construct a data iterator over observations in container `data`.
It uses available threads as workers to load observations in
parallel, leading to large speedups when threads are available.

To ensure that the active Julia session has multiple threads
available, check that `Threads.nthreads() > 1`. You can start
Julia with multiple threads with the `-t n` option. If your data
loading is bottlenecked by the CPU, it is recommended to set `n`
to the number of physical CPU cores.

## Arguments

- `data`: a data container that implements `getindex/getobs` and `length/numobs`
- `buffer = false`: whether to use inplace data loading with `getobs!`. Only use
    this if you need the additional performance and `getobs!` is implemented for
    `data`. Setting `buffer = true` means that when using the iterator, an
    observation is only valid for the current loop iteration.
- `executor = Folds.ThreadedEx()`: task scheduler
    You may specify a different task scheduler which can
    be any `Folds.Executor`.
- `channelsize = Threads.nthreads()`: the number of observations that are prefetched.
    Increasing `channelsize` can lead to speedups when per-observation processing
    time is irregular but will cause higher memory usage.

    RingBuffer(size, buffer)
    RingBuffer(buffers)

A `Channel`-like data structure that rotates through
`size` buffers. You can either pass in a vector of `buffers`, or
a single `buffer` that is copied `size` times.

`put!`s work by mutating one of the buffers:

```
put!(ringbuffer) do buf
    rand!(buf)
end
```

The result can then be `take!`n:

```
res = take!(ringbuffer)
```

!!! warning "Invalidation"

    Only one result is valid at a time! On the next `take!`, the previous
    result will be reused as a buffer and be mutated by a `put!`
